This is a Task management app.

It is for use in a company that have teams or individual with differenet tasks. The app will keep track of users and their tasks and the
status of the tasks. This is meant for admin purposes for companies with a varity of tasks that needs to be kept track of. It is also for 
employees to have a centralized place to go and double check their tasks. They can also set the status of their tasks to complete, tasks 
could be reassinged to other users and ofcourse users could be edited ( add/remove/change ). All data is also saved to a specified file 
and those files could be viewed by anyone by using any text editor.

All you would need to run this app is IDLE python. I have not made an executable that will allow for installation to a computer or mobile device.
